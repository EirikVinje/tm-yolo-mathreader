# tm-yolo-mathreader
This repository holds the YOLO x Tsetlin Machine object detection and symbol prediction for reading handwritten math expressions.

For a complete walkthrough of the project pipeline, head to [_src/complete_walkthrough.ipynb_](https://github.com/EirikVinje/tm-yolo-mathreader/blob/main/src/complete_walkthrough.ipynb) and follow the notebook.


**NOTE:** You will need to replace the API key to reproduce the results, as the API key is now deactivated.
